# GuessingGame
This is a simple game and my first play around with Elixir. Git clone, then `mix run` inside the directory to start the game.

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/guessing_game](https://hexdocs.pm/guessing_game).
